# Regression example using MobileNet
- Here we use the image of the user to train the model with specific values
- So if you raise your right hand and train the model to say it is 1.
-  if you raise your left hand and train the model to say it is 0.
-  After training when you raise your left hand an object will follow and your left hand
-  Indicating that you are at the left end of the screen
-  So this is an example of using regression using mobileNet
